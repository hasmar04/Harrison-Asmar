## What I Do
- I enjoy programming and learning about everything to do with technology through practical activities and experiments. I feel the best way to learn is to do something like you would in the real world, not in a unrealistically problem-free simulator. 
- I post updates on my blog about projects I've been working on as well as cool things I have found (https://blog.crankshafttech.com)
- I am currently studying the Diploma of IT Systems Administration and Advanced Networking at TAFE QLD. 
- I also work at Robotics Playground as a lead programmer and instructor for classes, teaching kids about the wonders of programming, robotics and engineering.
